# Useful Weapons to Have

In a survival situation, weapons serve multiple purposes, from self-defense to hunting for food. The choice of weapon depends on the environment, availability, and specific needs. Below is a guide to some of the most useful weapons for survival.

## 1. Firearms

### a. Rifle
- **Purpose**: Ideal for hunting large game and long-range defense.
