# Blackout Driving

**Blackout driving** is the practice of operating a vehicle with minimal or no visible lighting to avoid detection. This skill is crucial in scenarios where stealth is necessary, such as avoiding enemy observation or moving undetected in a hostile environment. Mastering blackout driving requires a combination of preparation, awareness, and technique.

## 1. Preparation for Blackout Driving

### a. Vehicle Modifications
- **Light Kill Switch**: Install a switch that disables all external lights, including headlights, brake lights, and turn signals. This switch should also shut off all dashboard lighting to prevent any internal glow that could give away your position. Ensure this switch is easily accessible to the driver.
- **Low-Intensity Lighting**: Use infrared or subdued red lighting inside the vehicle to maintain night vision while providing enough illumination to read instruments. Night Vision Goggles (NVGs) can be used effectively with infrared headlights, allowing you to see without revealing your position.

### b. Route Planning
- **Familiarize with Terrain**: Know the route in advance. Study maps and, if possible, drive the route during daylight to identify landmarks, turns, and obstacles.
- **Timing**: Perform blackout driving during the darkest hours of the night to reduce the risk of detection.
- **Weather Considerations**: Avoid driving in fog or heavy rain, which can obscure your view and make blackout driving more dangerous.

## 2. Techniques for Blackout Driving

### a. Speed Control
- **Slow and Steady**: Drive at a reduced speed to maintain control of the vehicle and avoid accidents. High speeds reduce reaction time and increase the risk of collision.
- **Engine Noise Management**: Keep the engine running smoothly and avoid sudden acceleration or deceleration that could draw attention.

### b. Visual Techniques
- **Night Vision**: Your eyes will take time to adjust to darkness. Avoid looking directly at bright lights to preserve your night vision.
- **Peripheral Vision**: Rely on peripheral vision, which is more sensitive to movement in low light. Focus on the edges of the road and use shadows as guides.
- **Light Discipline**: Never use interior lights, and if you must use a map or other tools, do so with a red or infrared light to minimize visibility. If using NVGs, ensure they are properly adjusted to avoid disorientation or tunnel vision.

### c. Navigation
- **Natural Landmarks**: Use the silhouettes of trees, hills, or other natural landmarks to guide your direction. Avoid relying solely on the road, which may be hard to see.
- **Distance Marking**: If possible, mark distances between key points during daytime reconnaissance to aid in navigation without lights.
- **Communication**: If moving in a convoy, establish communication signals (like hand signals or radio codes) that do not rely on visible lights.

## 3. Challenges and Countermeasures

### a. Visibility Hazards
- **Obstacles**: Be prepared for obstacles such as fallen branches, rocks, or uneven terrain that may be difficult to see. Slow down and stay alert.
- **Enemy Detection**: Minimize noise and avoid silhouetting your vehicle against the sky. Stay low in the landscape and use cover whenever possible.

### b. Vehicle Maintenance
- **Mechanical Reliability**: Ensure your vehicle is in top mechanical condition. A breakdown during blackout driving can be particularly dangerous.
- **Tire Pressure**: Check tire pressure to ensure optimal grip and control, especially on rough or unpaved roads.

### c. Emergency Procedures
- **Evade Detection**: If you suspect you've been detected, quickly and quietly move to a concealed location, shut off the engine, and wait for the threat to pass.
- **Escape Plan**: Always have an alternate route or escape plan in case the primary route becomes compromised.

## 4. Practice and Training

- **Night Driving Practice**: Regularly practice driving at night without using lights to build confidence and skill.
- **Simulated Conditions**: Train under various conditions, including different terrains and weather, to prepare for real-world blackout driving scenarios.
- **Team Coordination**: If operating in a group, practice convoy blackout driving to ensure all drivers are synchronized and understand the procedures.

## 5. Safety Considerations

- **Risk vs. Reward**: Evaluate whether blackout driving is necessary. The risks are significant, so it should only be employed when the benefits outweigh potential dangers.
- **Emergency Lights**: In case of an immediate threat to life, be prepared to use emergency lights or signals to prevent accidents.
